# cra-template-atlaskit-simple

This template includes a set of common used components from [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/) to give you a quick taste of how it is like. For more details and full documentation please visit the [home page](https://atlassian.design/components).

## How to use it?

As it is a `create-react-app` template, you can simply pass in an option `--template atlaskit-simple` when creating a react app with `create-react-app` (note here you don't have to specify prefix `cra-template-` as `create-react-app` will do that for you).

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template atlaskit-simple

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template atlaskit-simple
```
